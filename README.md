# VR Game Project
A game I am creating in Unity for VR. Currently all testing is performed on the Oculus Quest. For asset creation/modification, I typically use Blender. Assets I have incorporated into the game from the Unity asset store are listed in the text files in the Prefab and Materials folders. Assets from the asset store I have not fully decided yet whether to incorporate are typically listed under the Unused folder. However, the project is too large to fit on GitHub with all of those assets, so I have not uploaded the "Unused" file.
